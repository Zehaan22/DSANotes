    "### Problem of Local Minima in a Grid\n",

    "*Problem Statement*\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes $G[n][n]$ as input storing $n*n$ distinct integers. Output the local minima in some given range i.e\n",
    "$$G[i][j] | G[i][j] < G[i+1][j],G[i][j+1],G[i-1][j],G[i][j-1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <code>Single-scan-G</code>: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Single scan of G yield the local minima ~ $O(n^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <code>Local-exploration</code>: \n",
    "\n",
    "    For any grid element $G[i][j]$, look for a smaller nieghbour, repeat!</br>\n",
    "    If no smaller neighbour, return $G[i][j]$;</br>\n",
    "    No cell is visited twice ~ $O(n^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <code>Binary-Search_on1DArray</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If $A[mid]$ is not local minima in $A[L,...,R]$, then move to a neighbouring smallest element; namely mid-1 or mid+1\n",
    "    * Move to the new half and do the search there\n",
    "    * Reason why it works:\n",
    "        - For any array $[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,...]$\n",
    "        - If we consider the mid element say $[...,b,a,c,...]$\n",
    "        - WLOG consider $b < a$\n",
    "        - It suffices to prove that there exists a local minima in $[...,b] $\n",
    "        - That is clear as $b < a$\n",
    "        - If in $[...,d,b]$ $d<b$ then we can proceed recusively till the first element of the array\n",
    "        - If $d>b$ then we are done\n",
    "    * The time complexity on this is clear ~ $O(\\log(n))$\n",
